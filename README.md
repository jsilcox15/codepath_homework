# Project 3 - Kali

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

**Homework Instructions**: 

- [ ] Create a GIF recording of you running the following command block in your Kali Terminal. Copy it to a text editor first and **replace the first 2 variables, name and univ, with your real name and college name**, then copy/paste the code block into a Terminal. 

```bash
name="FirstName LastName"
univ="University of Science"

screenfetch
echo $name'@'$univ
```

Save the file as **screenfetch.gif**.

**Challenges and Problems**:
I was unable to run Docker on my main PC due to its outdated hardware so I had to use a laptop in order to complete this assignment. Additionally screenfetch was not installed initially so I had to down that.
